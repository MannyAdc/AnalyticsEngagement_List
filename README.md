Direct access to this repository was intended until the above GitHub page was constructed. I will make sure to update the contents when necessary.

# Overview
The above showcases my data science projects and tasks I engaged in. I included code repositories and figures from some of my works. For the works under confidentiality restrictions, I described the overviews and processes on a best-effort basis.

# Tip
Each project/task is tagged with keywords. Please search the keywords of your interest (e.g., technique, tool, process, topic).
